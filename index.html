		<h2>Hongxiang Zhao (赵泓翔)</h2>

	   <p>I am a senior student at <a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), China </a>, majoring in <a href="https://math.sustech.edu.cn/" target="_blank">mathematics </a>. My undergraduate mentor is <a href="http://yifeizhu.github.io" target="_blank">Yifei Zhu</a> . </p>
	   <p>My research interests are in algebraic number theory, algebraic topology, and related fields. I am currently learning connections between local class field theory and stable homotopy theory via Lubin-Tate formal group laws. </p>

		       <p> This is part of the senior thesis I am working on. The thesis has two goals. Firstly, we state and prove explicit local class field theory <span class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#224;</span> la Lubin and Tate. Secondly, we prove the existence and uniqueness of Ando's norm-coherent coordinates on deformations of formal groups in the context of structured multiplicative orientations in algebraic topology. The first part is almost finished, while the second part is only a sketch proof. I plan to finish the proof in second part and generalize the proof to liftings to arbitrary complete local ring. Furthermore, I hope to learn the significance of Ando's theorem in topology and add these into the thesis. </p>
		    <li> <a href="Writings/Quillen's plus construction and algebraic K-theory.pdf" target="_blank">Quillen's Plus Construction and Algebraic K-theory </a> </li>
		       <p> This is the final paper for the Algebraic Topology course taken in UCB taught by <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~teleman/" target="_blank">Prof. Constantin Teleman </a>. The survey gives an introduction to algebraic K-theory. We first introduce the classical definition of K_0, K_1 groups and some properties of them. Then we apply Quillen’s plus construction to construct general K_n and show that they are in accord with the previous definitions when n = 0, 1. Finally, we give a brief introduction to the K-theory <span class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2126;</span> spectrum. </p>
		    <li> <a href="Writings/Elliptic curves over C.pdf" target="_blank">Ellipltic Curves over <span class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2102;</span> </a> </li>
		       <p> This is a report for the Berkeley Mathematics Directed Reading Program in UCB. We talk about elliptic curves over complex numbers in this survey. First we introduce elliptic curves from the calculation of the arc lengths of ellipses, which is the historical origin of elliptic curves. Then we present some general basics of elliptic curves, like the group law and isogenies. Finally, we prove the equivalence of categories of elliptic curves over complex numbers and lattices in the complex plane. </p>
