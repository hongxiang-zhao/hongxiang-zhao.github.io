   <p>I am a senior student in Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), China, with a major in mathematics. My undergraduate mentor is <a href="http://yifeizhu.github.io">Yifei Zhu </a> </p>
   <p>My research interests are algebraic number theory, algebraic topology and related fields. I am also interested in learning Langlands Program, geometric Langlands Programm, mathematical physics, arithmetic topology, etc. </p>

               <p> This is a report for the Directed Reading Program in UCB. We discuss elliptic curves over complex numbers. We first introduce the elliptic curve from the calculation of the arc length of ellipse, which is the history origin of elliptic curve. Then we introduce some general basics of elliptic curves. Finally, we prove equivalences of categories between elliptic curves over C and lattices </p>
