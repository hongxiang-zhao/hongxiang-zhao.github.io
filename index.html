   <p>I am a senior student in Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), China, with a major in mathematics. My undergraduate mentor is <a href="http://yifeizhu.github.io">Yifei Zhu </a> </p>
   <p>My research interests are algebraic number theory, algebraic topology and related fields. I am also interested in learning Langlands Program, geometric Langlands Programm, mathematical physics, arithmetic topology, etc. </p>

               <p> This is a report for the Directed Reading Program in UCB. We talk about elliptic curves over complex numbers in this survey. First we introduce the elliptic curve from the calculation of the arc length of ellipse, which is the history origin of elliptic curve. Then some general basics of elliptic curves are presented. Finally, we prove equivalences of categories between elliptic curves over C and lattices </p>

               <p> This is the final paper for the Algebraic Topology course taken in UCB. The survey gives an introduction to algebraic K-theory. We first introduce the classical definition of K0, K1 groups and some properties of them. Then we apply Quillen’s plus construction to construct general Kn and show that they are accord with the previous definitions when n = 0, 1. Finally, we give a brief introduction to K-theory spectrum. </p>
