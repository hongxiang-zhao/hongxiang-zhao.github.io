	   <p>I am a senior student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), China, majoring in mathematics. My undergraduate mentor is <a href="http://yifeizhu.github.io" target="_blank">Yifei Zhu</a> . </p>
	   <p>My research interests are algebraic number theory, algebraic topology and related fields. I am also interested in learning Langlands Program, geometric Langlands Program, mathematical physics, arithmetic topology, etc. </p>

		    <li> <a href="Notes/Elliptic curves over C.pdf" target="_blank">Ellipltic curves over <span class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2102;</span> </a> </li>
		       <p> This is a report for the Berkeley Mathematics Directed Reading Program in UCB. We talk about elliptic curves over complex numbers in this survey. First we introduce elliptic curves from the calculation of the arc lengths of ellipses, which is the historical origin of elliptic curves. Then we present some general basics of elliptic curves. Finally, we prove the equivalences of categories between elliptic curves over complex numbers and lattices (that is, discrete subgroups of <span class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2102;</span> that contains an <span class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x211D;</span>-basis for <span class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2102;</span>. </p>
		    <li> <a href="Notes/Quillen's plus construction and algebraic K-theory.pdf" target="_blank">Quillen's plus construction and algebraic K-theory </a> </li>
		       <p> This is the final paper for the Algebraic Topology course taken in UCB. The survey gives an introduction to algebraic K-theory. We first introduce the classical definition of K_0, K_1 groups and some properties of them. Then we apply Quillenâ€™s plus construction to construct general K_n and show that they are in accord with the previous definitions when n = 0, 1. Finally, we give a brief introduction to the K-theory spectrum. </p>
		    <li> <a href="Notes/Lubin-Tate Theory.pdf" target="_blank">Proof of Local Class Field Theory by Lubin-Tate Formal Group Laws </a> </li>
		       <p> This is part of the senior thesis I am working on. The thesis is about Lubin-Tate Theory. The first topic is about the proof of local class field theory via Lubin-Tate formal group laws. In this part of the thesis, we first give a brief history of local class field theory. Then we prove local class field theory by Lubin-Tate formal group laws. I am now reading materials about complex multiplication of elliptic curves, which is the motivation of the proof. I plan to learn the connection between Lubin-Tate formal group laws and stable homotopy theory later and add this into the thesis. </p>
