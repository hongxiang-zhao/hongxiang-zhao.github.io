		<h2>Hongxiang Zhao </h2>

	   <p>I am a senior student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), China, majoring in mathematics. My undergraduate mentor is <a href="http://yifeizhu.github.io" target="_blank">Yifei Zhu</a> . </p>
	   <p>My research interests are algebraic number theory, algebraic topology and related fields. I am currently learning connections between local class field theory and stable homotopy theory via Lubin-Tate formal group laws. </p>

		       <p> This is part of the senior thesis I am working on. The thesis is about Lubin-Tate Theory. The first topic is about the proof of local class field theory via Lubin-Tate formal group laws. In this part of the thesis, we first give a brief history of local class field theory. Then we prove local class field theory by Lubin-Tate formal group laws. I am now reading materials about complex multiplication of elliptic curves, which is the motivation of the proof. I plan to learn the connection between Lubin-Tate formal group laws and stable homotopy theory later and add this into the thesis. </p>
		    <li> <a href="Writings/Quillen's plus construction and algebraic K-theory.pdf" target="_blank">Quillen's Plus Construction and Algebraic K-theory </a> </li>
		       <p> This is the final paper for the Algebraic Topology course taken in UCB taught by <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~teleman/" target="_blank">Prof. Constantin Teleman </a>. The survey gives an introduction to algebraic K-theory. We first introduce the classical definition of K_0, K_1 groups and some properties of them. Then we apply Quillenâ€™s plus construction to construct general K_n and show that they are in accord with the previous definitions when n = 0, 1. Finally, we give a brief introduction to the K-theory <span class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2126;</span> spectrum. </p>
		    <li> <a href="Writings/Elliptic curves over C.pdf" target="_blank">Ellipltic Curves over <span class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2102;</span> </a> </li>
		       <p> This is a report for the Berkeley Mathematics Directed Reading Program in UCB. We talk about elliptic curves over complex numbers in this survey. First we introduce elliptic curves from the calculation of the arc lengths of ellipses, which is the historical origin of elliptic curves. Then we present some general basics of elliptic curves, like the group law and isogenies. Finally, we prove the equivalence of categories of elliptic curves over complex numbers and lattices in the complex plane. </p>
