	   <p>I am a senior student in Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), China, with a major in mathematics. My undergraduate mentor is <a href="http://yifeizhu.github.io">Yifei Zhu </a> </p>
	   <p>My research interests are algebraic number theory, algebraic topology and related fields. I am also interested in learning Langlands Program, geometric Langlands Programm, mathematical physics, arithmetic topology, etc. </p>

		    <li> <a href="Notes/Elliptic curves over C.pdf" target="_blank">Ellipltic curves over complex numbers </a> </li>
		       <p> This is a report for the Directed Reading Program in UCB. We talk about elliptic curves over complex numbers in this survey. First we introduce the elliptic curve from the calculation of the arc length of ellipse, which is the historical origin of elliptic curve. Then some general basics of elliptic curves are presented. Finally, we prove the equivalences of categories between elliptic curves over complex numbers and lattices </p>
		    <li> <a href="Notes/Quillen's plus construction and algebraic K-theory.pdf" target="_blank">Quillen's plus construction and algebraic K-theory </a> </li>
		       <p> This is the final paper for the Algebraic Topology course taken in UCB. The survey gives an introduction to algebraic K-theory. We first introduce the classical definition of K_0, K_1 groups and some properties of them. Then we apply Quillen’s plus construction to construct general K_n and show that they are accord with the previous definitions when n = 0, 1. Finally, we give a brief introduction to the K-theory spectrum. </p>
		    <li> <a href="Notes/Lubin-Tate Theory.pdf" target="_blank">Proof of Local Class Field Theory by Lubin-Tate Formal Group Laws </a> </li>
		       <p> This is a draft of the senior thesis I am working on. The thesis is about Lubin-Tate Theory. The first topic is about the proof of local class field theory via Lubin-Tate formal group laws. In this version of the thesis, we first give a brief history of local class field theory. Then we prove local class field theory by Lubin-Tate formal group laws. I am now reading materials about complex multiplication, which is where the proof came from. I plan to learn the connection between Lubin-Tate formal group laws and stable homotopy theory later and add this into the thesis. </p>
